Approach 1: Using a Function with a List
Functionality: This snippet defines a function doubleL(n) which creates a list res. It iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to n-1, doubling each number and appending it to the list. Finally, it returns the list.
Computation: The function computes the doubled values in advance and stores them in a list, which is then returned.


Approach 2: Using List Comprehension
Functionality: This snippet does not use a function. Instead, it directly uses a list comprehension [n * 2 for n in range(5)] to create a list of doubled values. This list is immediately iterated over to print the values.
Computation: Similar to the first approach, it computes all doubled values in advance and stores them in a list. However, it does so more concisely using list comprehension.


Approach 3: Using a Generator Function
Functionality: doubleG(n) is a generator function. It uses the yield statement to generate each doubled value on-the-fly during iteration, rather than computing all values in advance.
Computation: Unlike the previous approaches, this function does not store all the doubled values at once. It generates each value when needed during the iteration.

Type and Advantage of doubleG(n)
Type of Function: doubleG(n) is a generator function.
Advantages:
    Memory Efficiency: It is more memory-efficient, especially for large ranges of n. Generator functions produce one item at a time and do not require the entire list to be stored in memory.
    Lazy Evaluation: It allows for lazy evaluation, where values are generated only as needed. This can lead to performance improvements, especially if the entire list of generated items is not always required.
Flexibility in Iteration: It can be more flexible in scenarios where the process might be interrupted, or not all values are needed, as it calculates values on-the-go.
In summary, while all three approaches generate the same output, they do so in different ways, with the generator function offering benefits in terms of memory efficiency and lazy evaluation.
